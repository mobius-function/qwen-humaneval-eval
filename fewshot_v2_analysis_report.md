# Fewshot_v2 Analysis Report and Recommendations

## Executive Summary

The `fewshot_v2` prompt achieved only **34.1% success rate** (56/164 test cases passed) on HumanEval. This is critically low and requires immediate intervention. The analysis reveals two dominant failure modes:

1. **Placeholder Code (60.2% of failures)** - Model outputs `# Your code here` and `pass` instead of implementations
2. **Logic Errors (43.5% of failures)** - Even when code is written, it doesn't correctly solve the problem

## Detailed Failure Analysis

### 1. Overall Statistics
- **Success Rate**: 34.1% (56/164)
- **Failure Rate**: 65.9% (108/164)
- **Total Failures Analyzed**: 108 cases

### 2. Top Failure Categories

| Failure Type | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| PLACEHOLDER_PASS | 38 | 35.2% |
| LOGIC_ERROR | 35 | 32.4% |
| PLACEHOLDER_COMMENT | 27 | 25.0% |
| ASSERTION_FAILED | 12 | 11.1% |
| MISSING_SORT | 3 | 2.8% |
| MISSING_EDGE_CASE | 2 | 1.9% |
| IF_REPETITION | 1 | 0.9% |
| CODE_REPETITION | 1 | 0.9% |

**Critical Insight**: Placeholders account for **65 out of 108 failures (60.2%)**. This is the #1 issue to address.

### 3. Success Rates by Problem Category

| Category | Success Rate | Details |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| parsing | 22.2% | 2/9 passed |
| logic_algorithm | 24.1% | 7/29 passed |
| math_operations | 25.0% | 12/48 passed |
| edge_cases | 26.9% | 7/26 passed |
| list_operations | 32.2% | 28/87 passed |
| string_manipulation | 34.8% | 23/66 passed |
| data_structures | 42.9% | 6/14 passed |
| uncategorized | 53.8% | 7/13 passed |

**Most Problematic**: Parsing, logic/algorithm, and math problems have sub-25% success rates.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Weak Anti-Placeholder Language
**Current prompt line 194**: "4. Implement the logic completely - no placeholders"

**Problem**: This single bullet point is insufficient. The model still outputs:
- `# Your code here` + `pass` (38 cases)
- `# Your code here` + partial code (27 cases)

### Issue 2: Examples Are Too Simple
The 6 examples in fewshot_v2 are all straightforward:
1. `find_max` - simple iteration
2. `count_vowels` - simple counting
3. `remove_duplicates` - set usage
4. `reverse_words` - string split/join
5. `filter_positive_even` - simple filtering
6. `is_perfect_square` - basic math

**Missing**: No examples of parsing, complex logic, recursive algorithms, or mathematical sequences.

### Issue 3: No Explicit Edge Case Examples
While the prompt mentions "identify edge cases," the examples don't strongly demonstrate edge case handling. Only 2 out of 6 examples have explicit edge case checks at the start.

### Issue 4: No Examples of What NOT to Do
The prompt doesn't show examples of incorrect/placeholder code to avoid.

## Comparison with Current Prompt

### Current fewshot_v2 (lines 111-198 in advanced_prompts.py)

```python
def create_fewshot_v2_prompt(problem: str) -> str:
    examples = '''Here are examples of correct Python function implementations:
    [6 simple examples]

    Now implement this function. Think through it step by step:
    1. Read the docstring carefully - what is the exact requirement?
    2. Identify edge cases from the examples
    3. Choose the right approach (iteration, recursion, built-ins)
    4. Implement the logic completely - no placeholders
    '''
```

**Weaknesses**:
- ❌ Too passive ("Think through it step by step" doesn't force action)
- ❌ "no placeholders" is buried in bullet 4
- ❌ No explicit ban on "# Your code here", "pass", "TODO"
- ❌ Examples too simple (all ≤10 lines)
- ❌ No parsing, recursion, or complex algorithm examples

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: HIGH - Address Placeholder Problem (60.2% of failures)

**Action Items**:
1. **Add emphatic anti-placeholder instructions** at the top and bottom
2. **Explicitly list forbidden patterns**: "# Your code here", "pass", "TODO", etc.
3. **Use directive language**: "You MUST write complete code" instead of "Implement completely"
4. **Add visual separation** to make the warning stand out

**Suggested wording**:
```
⚠️ CRITICAL: You MUST provide a complete, working implementation.
DO NOT use any of these placeholder patterns:
  - "# Your code here"
  - "# TODO"
  - "pass"
  - "# Write your code here"

Write actual code that solves the problem.
```

### Priority 2: HIGH - Improve Example Diversity (43.5% logic errors)

**Add 3-4 more examples covering**:
1. **Parsing/Bracket matching** (22.2% success rate)
   - Example: balanced parentheses checker with stack
2. **Math sequences** (25% success rate)
   - Example: Fibonacci or factorial with edge cases
3. **Complex logic** (24.1% success rate)
   - Example: Problem requiring multiple conditions
4. **Recursive algorithms**
   - Example: Tree traversal or recursive list processing

### Priority 3: MEDIUM - Strengthen Edge Case Emphasis

**Add explicit section**:
```
EDGE CASES TO ALWAYS CHECK:
- Empty inputs ([], "", None)
- Single element inputs
- Negative numbers (if applicable)
- Zero values
- Boundary conditions mentioned in docstring
```

### Priority 4: MEDIUM - Add Self-Verification Step

**Add at the end**:
```
Before submitting, verify:
✓ No placeholder code (no "pass", no "# TODO", no comments without code)
✓ All edge cases from docstring are handled
✓ Return type matches specification
✓ All example test cases would pass
```

## Proposed New Prompt: fewshot_v4

See implementation in the next section. Key improvements:

1. ⚠️ **Anti-placeholder warning** at top (addresses 60.2% of failures)
2. **9 examples** instead of 6, including:
   - Parsing (bracket matching)
   - Math sequences (Collatz)
   - Complex logic (prime checking)
3. **Explicit edge case handling** in every example
4. **Self-verification checklist** at the end
5. **Stronger directive language** ("MUST write", not "implement")

## Expected Impact

**Conservative estimate**: Addressing placeholders alone could improve success rate from 34.1% to 50%+

**Optimistic estimate**: With all improvements (better examples + edge case emphasis + verification), could reach 60-65% success rate.

## Post-Processing Improvements (Secondary)

While the focus should be on prompt improvements, these post-processing enhancements could help:

1. **Placeholder Detection**: Reject and retry if output contains only "pass" or "# Your code here"
2. **Minimum Complexity Check**: Require at least 3-5 non-trivial lines of code
3. **Edge Case Injection**: Auto-add empty input checks if mentioned in docstring
4. **AST Validation**: Parse before execution to catch syntax errors early

## Conclusion

The fewshot_v2 prompt has **critical deficiencies** in addressing placeholder code (60% of failures). The recommended fewshot_v4 prompt directly addresses this with:
- Emphatic anti-placeholder warnings
- More diverse and complex examples
- Explicit edge case guidance
- Self-verification checklist

**Next Steps**:
1. Implement `create_fewshot_v4_prompt()` function
2. Test on HumanEval benchmark
3. Compare results against fewshot_v2
4. Iterate based on new failure patterns
