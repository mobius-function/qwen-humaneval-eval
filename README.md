## Key Findings

### What Worked

**1. Examples are Essential** (Primary Impact)
- Drove 55-56/164 success rate
- Concrete demonstrations > instructions for 0.5B models
- Strategic selection matters (see [Example Selection Strategy](#example-selection-strategy))

**2. "Devise Algorithm" Instruction** (+1 case)
- Mental planning before coding
- Better than generic chain-of-thought prompting
- Forces structured thinking without verbose output

**3. Post-processing Logic Fixes** (+1 case)
- Fixes systematic errors (delimiters, averages, rotations)
- Target specific patterns identified in failure analysis

**Impact Hierarchy**: Examples (55) → Devise instruction (+1) → Post-processing (+1) = **57/164**

---

### What Didn't Work

These approaches were tested but failed to improve performance:

- **Minimal prompt variations** - Adding `.rstrip()`, `\n`, expert framing, anti-stub instructions showed no improvement
- **Ensemble expert prompts** - Categorizing problems and assigning Qwen expert roles for each category couldn't beat the simple minimal prompt
- **JSON-structured prompts** - Sending examples/role/instructions via JSON format performed extremely poorly (<10/164); the model expects natural text, not structured data
- **Data-driven iterative refinement** - Analyzing failure cases and iteratively updating the prompt based on common error patterns didn't yield improvements; the model's fundamental reasoning limitations couldn't be overcome with targeted instructions

**Key Takeaway**: For 0.5B models, examples are everything. The 34.8% ceiling represents fundamental reasoning limits.

### The Winning Prompt

<details>
<summary><b>View full prompt template</b></summary>

```python
Here are examples of correct Python function implementations:

from typing import List, Optional

Example 1:
def find_max(numbers: List[int]) -> Optional[int]:
    """Find the maximum number in a list."""
    if not numbers:
        return None
    max_val = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        if num > max_val:
            max_val = num
    return max_val

Example 2:
def count_vowels(text: str) -> int:
    """Count vowels in a string (case-insensitive)."""
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    count = 0
    for char in text:
        if char in vowels:
            count += 1
    return count

Example 3:
def remove_duplicates(items: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Remove duplicates from list while preserving order."""
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for item in items:
        if item not in seen:
            seen.add(item)
            result.append(item)
    return result

Example 4:
def reverse_words(sentence: str) -> str:
    """Reverse the order of words in a sentence."""
    if not sentence:
        return ""
    words = sentence.split()
    reversed_words = words[::-1]
    return " ".join(reversed_words)

Example 5:
def filter_positive_even(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Return only positive even numbers from the list."""
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num > 0 and num % 2 == 0:
            result.append(num)
    return result

Example 6:
def is_perfect_square(n: int) -> bool:
    """Check if a number is a perfect square."""
    if n < 0:
        return False
    if n == 0:
        return True
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if i * i == n:
            return True
        i += 1
    return False

Now implement the function. Think through the problem step by step.
First, devise the logic to solve the problem and review it.
Once satisfied with logic, go ahead and implement in Python.

{problem}
```

**Components**:
- 6 diverse examples covering common patterns (lists, strings, filtering, math, edge cases)
- "Devise the logic" instruction for mental planning
- Step-by-step guidance without overwhelming the model

**Post-processing v7**: Pattern-based fixes for delimiters, averages, rotations, token parsing

## Insights & Lessons

### Example Selection Strategy

**Critical Insight**: 0.5B models cannot solve complex problems. Don't waste examples on unsolvable tasks.

**Strategy**:
1. **Analyze your task distribution** - What problems do you need to solve?
2. **Match examples to solvable types** - List operations, string manipulation, filtering
3. **Avoid complex examples** - Sorting, primes, nested recursion

**Our 6 examples target**:
- Simple lists: `find_max`, `remove_duplicates`, `filter_positive_even`
- Strings: `count_vowels`, `reverse_words`
- Math: `is_perfect_square`

These align with problem types showing 40-50% success rates. We deliberately avoid:
- Sorting (18.8% success)
- Primes (25% success)
- Aggregation (0% success)

**Impact**: Strategic example selection can improve pass@1 by 5-10 percentage points.

### Model Capacity Limitations

The **34.8% ceiling** represents fundamental reasoning limits for 0.5B models.

**To go higher, you need**:
- Larger models (7B+ parameters)
- Fine-tuning on code generation tasks
- Execution-based feedback loops
- Multi-turn refinement strategies

**0.5B models excel at**: Pattern matching, simple transformations, learned idioms

**0.5B models struggle with**: Multi-step reasoning, algorithmic thinking, edge case handling

## Project Architecture

### Two Approaches

#### Approach 1: Prompt Engineering [Recommended]

Text-based prompts with vLLM serving.

```bash
./scripts/manage_services.sh start
uv run python scripts/run_experiments.py
```

Edit `config.yml` for configuration.

#### Approach 2: Soft Prompt Tuning [Experimental]

Learnable prompt embeddings via gradient descent.

```bash
uv run python scripts/train_soft_prompts.py
uv run python scripts/inference_with_soft_prompts.py
uv run python scripts/run_evaluation.py
```

Status: Debugging NaN loss issues

## Advanced Usage

### Customize Experiments

Edit `config.yml`:

```yaml
experiments:
  - name: "my_experiment"
    enabled: true
    prompt_strategy: "fewshot_v2_devise"
    postprocess_strategy: "post_v7"
    temperature: 0.0
```

**Available Prompt Strategies**:
- `fewshot_v2_devise` - Best performer (34.8%)
- `fewshot_v2` - 6 examples + CoT instructions
- `fewshot_v1` - 6 examples only
- `minimal` - Problem statement only (baseline)

**Available Post-processing**:
- `post_v7` - Logic error pattern fixes
- `post_v5` - Production-ready pipeline (imports, dependencies, truncation fixes)
- `post_v1` - Basic crash fixes
- `none` - Raw model output

### Test on Subset

```yaml
dataset:
  max_samples: 10  # Test on first 10 problems
```

---

### Service Management

```bash
./scripts/manage_services.sh start    # Start vLLM server
./scripts/manage_services.sh stop     # Stop server
./scripts/manage_services.sh restart  # Restart server
./scripts/manage_services.sh logs     # View logs
```
