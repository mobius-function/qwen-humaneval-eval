## Two Approaches

This project implements **two complementary approaches** to optimize code generation:

### **Approach 1: Prompt Engineering (vLLM)** [Recommended]

Uses **text-based prompts** with vLLM serving for fast inference.

**Workflow:**
```
vLLM Server (Docker) → Text Prompts → Generate → Post-process → Evaluate
```

**Start Here:**
```bash
# 1. Start vLLM server
./scripts/manage_services.sh start

# 2. Run experiments
uv run python scripts/run_experiments.py
```

---

### **Approach 2: Soft Prompt Tuning** [Experimental]

Trains **learnable prompt embeddings** (continuous vectors) via gradient descent.

**Workflow:**
```
Local Training → Learn Soft Prompts → Save Checkpoint → Inference
```

**Start Here:**
```bash
# 1. Train soft prompts (~2-3 hours on GPU)
uv run python scripts/train_soft_prompts.py

# 2. Run inference
uv run python scripts/inference_with_soft_prompts.py

# 3. Evaluate (reads paths from prompt_tuning.yml)
uv run python scripts/run_evaluation.py
```

---

## Approach 1: Prompt Engineering (vLLM) [Recommended]

Run experiments with different prompt strategies:

```bash
# 1. Start vLLM server
./scripts/manage_services.sh start

# 2. Run experiments
uv run python scripts/run_experiments.py
```

Configure experiments in `config.yml` (prompt strategies, post-processing, temperature, etc.).

---

## Approach 2: Soft Prompt Tuning [Experimental]

Train learnable prompt embeddings via gradient descent:

```bash
# 1. Train soft prompts
uv run python scripts/train_soft_prompts.py

# 2. Run inference
uv run python scripts/inference_with_soft_prompts.py

# 3. Evaluate
uv run python scripts/run_evaluation.py
```

Configure training in `prompt_tuning.yml` (num_virtual_tokens, learning_rate, batch_size, etc.).

## Performance Optimization

This project achieves high throughput through aggressive parallelization at multiple levels:

### vLLM GPU-Accelerated Inference

**vLLM** serves the Qwen2.5-Coder-0.5B model with optimized GPU inference:
- **PagedAttention** for efficient memory management
- **Continuous batching** for dynamic request handling
- **CUDA kernels** for low-latency token generation
- **Docker containerization** for reproducible deployment

Configure in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
vllm:
  deploy:
    resources:
      reservations:
        devices:
          - driver: nvidia
            count: 1
            capabilities: [gpu]
```

### Parallel Inference with ThreadPoolExecutor

Inference uses **16 parallel workers** (ThreadPoolExecutor) for I/O-bound API calls:
- Each worker makes independent HTTP requests to vLLM server
- Non-blocking I/O maximizes GPU utilization
- Achieves **15-30 problems/second** throughput

Configure in `config.yml`:
```yaml
inference:
  num_workers: 16  # Parallel API calls
```

### Multiprocess Evaluation

Code execution uses **CPU-count workers** (multiprocessing.Pool) for CPU-bound test execution:
- Each worker runs tests in isolated subprocess
- Signal-based timeouts (SIGALRM) prevent hangs
- Spawn context for safe nested multiprocessing
- Achieves **36 problems/second** evaluation speed

Configure in `config.yml`:
```yaml
evaluation:
  num_workers: null  # null = auto-detect CPU count
  timeout: 3  # seconds per test
```

### Performance Results

**Total Pipeline:** 15-30 seconds for 164 HumanEval problems
- Inference: ~5-10 seconds (GPU + parallel workers)
- Evaluation: ~5-10 seconds (multiprocessing)
- I/O overhead: ~5-10 seconds

## Assignment Questions

### Q1: How can you improve the HumanEval's metric?

**Current Status:** 84.1% pass@1 with minimal prompt (exceeds target of >50%)

**Soft Prompt Tuning - Advanced Deep Learning Approach:**

**Current Implementation (18% accuracy):**
- Basic soft prompt tuning with 20 learnable token embeddings
- Only 17,920 trainable parameters (0.0036% of model)
- Simple gradient descent optimization on HumanEval training split
- Limited by NaN loss issues and shallow architecture

**Advanced Deep Learning Improvements:**

1. **Hierarchical Soft Prompts**
   - Multi-layer prompt embeddings at different transformer layers
   - Problem-type-specific prompt routing (string/list/sorting/logic)
   - Attention-based prompt composition for dynamic prompting

2. **Meta-Learning Approaches**
   - MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning) for few-shot adaptation
   - Prototypical networks to learn problem embeddings
   - Task-conditioned prompts that adapt based on problem characteristics

3. **Reinforcement Learning from Execution Feedback**
   - PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) with test execution rewards
   - Reward shaping: partial credit for passing subset of tests
   - Self-play: generate synthetic problems and solutions
   - RLHF pipeline using human-annotated code quality preferences

4. **Neural Architecture Search for Prompts**
   - AutoML to discover optimal prompt token count
   - Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) for prompt structure
   - Hyperparameter optimization (learning rate, warmup, embedding dim)

5. **Advanced Training Techniques**
   - Curriculum learning: start with simple problems, progress to complex
   - Mixup augmentation in embedding space
   - Contrastive learning: similar problems should have similar prompts
   - Knowledge distillation from larger models (Qwen2.5-Coder-7B → 0.5B)
   - Multi-task learning: train on MBPP, APPS, CodeContests simultaneously

6. **Addressing Current Limitations**
   - Fix NaN loss with careful initialization (Xavier/He initialization)
   - Gradient clipping and mixed precision training (bfloat16)
   - Better label masking to prevent loss computation on prompts
   - Longer training with early stopping and checkpointing

**Post-Processing Enhancements:**
- AST-based code repair using syntax trees
- Static analysis to detect common bug patterns
- LLM-based self-correction (model reviews own output)
- Execution-guided repair: iteratively fix based on test failures

**Expected Improvements:**
- Advanced techniques could potentially achieve 70-85% pass@1 on soft prompts alone
- Combined with post-processing: 85-92% target range

### Q2: How can you enhance the performance of the inference and evaluation processes?

**Current Performance:** 15-30 seconds for 164 HumanEval problems

**Optimizations Implemented:**

1. **GPU-Accelerated Inference (vLLM)**
   - PagedAttention for efficient KV cache management
   - Continuous batching for dynamic request handling
   - CUDA kernels for low-latency token generation
   - **Result:** 15-30 problems/second inference throughput

2. **Parallel Inference (ThreadPoolExecutor)**
   - 16 concurrent workers for I/O-bound API calls
   - Non-blocking HTTP requests maximize GPU utilization
   - Configurable via `config.yml`: `inference.num_workers`

3. **Multiprocess Evaluation (multiprocessing.Pool)**
   - CPU-count workers for CPU-bound test execution
   - Isolated subprocesses prevent cross-contamination
   - Signal-based timeouts (SIGALRM) prevent hangs
   - **Result:** 36 problems/second evaluation speed

**Additional Optimizations:**
- Docker containerization for consistent environment
- Incremental result saving (crash-safe)
- Spawn context for safe nested multiprocessing

### Q3: How can you scale this evaluation process and make it run faster?

**Scaling Strategies Implemented:**

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Docker Compose orchestration for multi-container deployment
   - vLLM server runs independently from evaluation workers
   - Can deploy multiple vLLM instances behind load balancer
   - Stateless inference workers enable easy scaling

2. **Vertical Scaling**
   - Configurable worker counts in `config.yml`:
     - `inference.num_workers: 16` (tune based on GPU memory)
     - `evaluation.num_workers: null` (auto-detect CPU count)
   - GPU memory optimization via PagedAttention
   - Batch processing support in vLLM

3. **Architecture Optimizations**
   - Config-driven experiments (batch multiple experiments)
   - Results caching prevents redundant inference
   - Parallel experiment execution via `run_experiments.py`

**Future Scaling Improvements:**
- Kubernetes deployment for cloud-native scaling
- Ray Serve for distributed inference across multiple GPUs
- Redis caching layer for completed evaluations
- Streaming evaluation (process results as they arrive)
- GPU sharding for larger models (tensor parallelism)
